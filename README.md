## About

This workout tracker allows you to enter either a new exercise or continue a current exercise. Then you can select your type of workout, cardio or resistance. From there, you fill out the fields, and add your exercise to your dashboard. If you want to view your workout history, go to the dashboard and you'll be presented with a line and bar graph of your progress.
